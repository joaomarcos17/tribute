                              <h2>Got A question? Maybe I can help.</h2>

                                        <h2>FAQs</h2>
                       
                        
                       <p><strong>1. The quote given over the phone or via email will be the final price?</strong></p>
                             
                              
                        <p>Any quote given by email, telephone, online or any other method is only an estimate, the actual price
                        can only be given after a representative from Mrs Brilliant has visited client premises. The quote given
                        can change, should there be any further cleaning requirements during the cleaning process, which was not 
                        initially disclosed or was missed out during any stage of the quotation process, like extra rooms or the 
                        real condition of the property haven't been state properly by the customer, but we will let you know if 
                        any changes will add up before the cleaning commerce.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.Do you provide weekly cleaning service?</strong></p>

                        <p>No, Mrs Brilliant does not provide weekly cleaning for now, but because we have been asked so many times,
                         we are planning to start really soon. We will start our own First Class Cleaning Training Academy, where 
                         you can learn with us and open your own first class business or become a Mrs Brilliant cleaner, where you
                         will be working for Mrs Brilliant, to provide a weekly cleaning & end of tenancy cleaning. Please Watch 
                         this space. </p>

                        <p><strong>3.Do you have liability insurance and your staff is fully vetted?</strong></p>

                        <p>Yes, we have liability insurance and we are fully vetted.</p>

                        <p><strong>4.Do you guarantee that we have our deposit back?</strong></p>

                        <p>We guarantee 100% what is regarding cleaning part or your money back. We cannot guarantee if you have 
                        damaged something in the property, for example, scratches in the stain steel hob or cooker hood, stains
                        that cannot be removed from carpets, that is not previously specified in your inventory that you get when
                        you rented a property.</p>

                        <p><strong>5.Do you require a deposit?</strong></p>

                        <p>Payments is made by cash only at the completion of the job, no deposit is required, but for any reason,
                        you are unable to be there at the end of the cleaning job to make a payment, then payments have to be made 
                        before the cleaning start, by bank transfer. Mrs Brilliant does not accept payments by bank transfer after
                        the cleaning is done. </p>

                        <p><strong>6.Do you provide cleaning materials and equipment?</strong></p>

                        <p>Yes, we provide all and the best of cleaning materials and equipment necessary for the job.</p>

                        <p><strong>7.Do you clean ovens professionally? is this job included in the cleaning quote or do you charge extra 
                        for that?</strong></p>

                        <p>We clean ovens professionally at a high standard. Oven cleaning will just be provided in addition to our end of
                        tenancy cleaning and will be an extra charge for that. Unfortunately, we do not provide just oven cleaning services,
                        due to the amount of time that take us to clean an oven.</p>

                        <p><strong>8.Do you work on Sundays?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, we can work on Sundays, but an extra charge will be applied.</p>

                        <p><strong>9.Do you charge per hour or per job?</strong></p>
                        <p>It depends, we can charge per hour if the job is small or we can charge per day when the job takes more than one 
                         day to finish it, whichever is cheaper for the customer.</p>

                        <p><strong>10.Do you charge extra for pets ?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, we charge an extra 15% to 20% on top the original price quoted, depending on how many pets have been living in 
                         property, due to the time spent removing the fur from cabnets, radiators, tiles and so on.</p>
